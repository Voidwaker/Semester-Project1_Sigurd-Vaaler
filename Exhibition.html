            Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
            sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
            sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the

          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.

            t is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
            on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
            exciting ‘space’.

            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
            the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
            and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
            question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
            here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
            framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
            know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
            meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
            Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
