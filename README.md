# community Sciience Museum
the first semester exame of our schoool year-
this was built purly of html/css, as we not had learned javascrtipt yet.
the brief was to build a website for a museum "community science museum" for childrens from 7-15 years old, the brief spessified that the site should dispaly the exhibits and opening hours

## site purpose
the purpose was to showcase the diffrent exhibits and events the museume had that catered to the children/young adults (ages 7-15) what facilities were available and that you as an school could book evenets on the museume, to learn something new, and letting the people know the location on the newly built museum itself.

## desription

-- homepage

there little to no specifications in the brife other than certan sniuppets of onformation, and we could lay it out anyway we saw fit, I choosed to have the homepage with a "program" so that the first thing everyone visting the site saw, was the special events/ exhibits and also what thime they started, on the hompegae i choose to go with a pretty standard header, to make the navigation clean and easy to follow, also the footer displayed contact info for both private persons and schools. 

--exhibits

i tried to make the exhibit page as intuative as possibel for the target audience, showcasing alot of cool images, and tried to make the text easy to follow, not too much cause as a 7-15yr old, the main prioroty is not to read, but to look at images, so i had to be strategic with the image placements, and hower effects etc. this was a bit challeing. but we made it work, displaying every exhibit


--special events

spesific events give, alongside with images for uis to include in our design-- i asked "teknsik museum oslo" if i could borrow any of theyr pictures to make the site a bit more outstanding (since this was a school project, i got the greeen light, but the images they provided was too big, or too bad quailty, so i scrapoed the idea, and continued with the images provided for the brief.
